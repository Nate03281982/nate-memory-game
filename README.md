Game:
This is a game where you turn over tiles in order to find two logos that match.  
The game ends once you match all the tiles on the board.

Turn over two tiles until you have a match.  You want to find all the matches as soon as possible.  There is a timer that begins on your first click.
You can win stars for finishing the game is the lowest possible moves.

How I built the game:
-I used HTML and CSS to style the game
-I used vanilla JavaScript to create the card flipping logic
-I created a deck (array) of cards that is shuffled every time you start the game
-The shuffle function is from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976
-I set up a move counter that keeps track of every two titles flipped
-I build a timer that starts on the first click
-I made an alert that pops up when you win the game
